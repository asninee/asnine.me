## Motivation

I've spoken a bit about this in my [first blog post](https://asnine.me/blog/a-new-start), but I've always had an appreciation for minimal portfolio sites, where individuals such as [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me), [Rauno Freiberg](https://raunofreiberg.com) and [Fabian Schultz](https://www.fabianschultz.com) have done an exceptional job in bringing out their personalities through a simplistic, yet elegant manner with their websites. It was their sites that acted as the inspiration towards me building out a minimal portfolio site.
