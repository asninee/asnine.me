        Hey! I'm <strong>Ashraf</strong>, a full-stack developer based in the
        UK. Currently working at <Link href='https://www.evelyn.com'
          >Evelyn Partners</Link
        >. Continously looking to hone my craft by building out simple,
        functional and elegant applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion ties towards creating services that can bring forward
        transformative changes to society, where the emergence of touch-based
        devices fascinated me as a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love exploring the latest and greatest in the tech sphere, where I
        value high-quality products that are utilitarian in nature, but also
        incorporate a sleek aesthetic.
      </p>
