Below is a list of all the key tools, software and hardware that I use on the regular, with some screenshots added also for some eye-candy (or not ðŸ˜†). Feel free to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's `/uses` pages!

## Hardware

<SectionList>
  <SectionListItem
    badge='laptop'
    title='MacBook Pro 14-in'
    desc='Iâ€™ve got the base config option (16/512, M1 Pro chip). This has done wonders to my productivity thanks to the perf, with battery for days (literally). I wonder why I didnâ€™t switch to Mac earlier.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='monitor'
    title='MSI PRO MP275Q'
    desc='Works at 1440p@100Hz. Gives me more than enough screen estate to tackle whatever may come my way, while having a decent-enough PPI to work well with my Mac.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='phone'
    title='iPhone 16 Pro Max'
    desc='Does "phone" things. Itâ€™s simple, nails the fundamentals, and allows me to be more present in the moment (Iâ€™ve set it up to have a very small catalogue of essential apps).'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='watch'
    title='Apple Watch Series 8'
    desc='Acts as a nice companion device to my phone, keeping me in the loop while also having a very comprehensive suite of health tracking features. The "Overnight Vitals" feature has been able to pick up when Iâ€™ve fallen ill, which is like, wow.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='earbuds'
    title='Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro'
    desc='These sound amazing to the point that Iâ€™d recommend getting them over the new 3 Pros (thereâ€™s not much of an improvement sound quality wise, in addition to the fact that they look like AirPods clones).'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='iems'
    title='Truthear Hola'
    desc='For Â£18 (now discontinued), these were a crazy steal, where they sound closer to Â£80 iems. These paired together with my Mac (and lossless playback) make for an amazing combo; long may they live.'
  />
</SectionList>

## Software

<SectionList>
  <SectionListItem
    badge='editor'
    title='Visual Studio Code'
    href='https://code.visualstudio.com'
    desc='Comes with a vast ecosystem of extensions, making me able to tailor it towards the languages I use, and code with minimal friction.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='terminal'
    title='Ghostty'
    href='https://ghostty.org/'
    desc='Itâ€™s blazing fast (it uses Zig under the hood), allows me to blitz through any commands/scripts that I need to run, and has a fantastic community behind it.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='browser'
    title='Zen Browser'
    href='https://zen-browser.app/'
    desc='Embeds the key "wins" of Arc, such as "Spaces" and "Pinned Tabs", but spits them out in a Firefox fork. Iâ€™ve had an eye on this browser for a while since Arc went into maintenance-mode, but things have progressed along to the point that I can happily daily this now.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='launcher'
    title='Raycast'
    href='https://www.raycast.com'
    desc='Phenomenal for quickly opening apps, running custom tasks (e.g. emptying the trash), and has a nice ecosystem of extensions that can run custom tasks related to specific applications (e.g. showing the currently playing song on Spotify).'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='passwords'
    title='1Password'
    href='https://1password.com'
    desc='Comes with an integrated SSH agent (which is very handy). It was the first offering to provide Passkeys support (iirc), and comes with this nice "Watchtower" feature where you can see how strong your passwords are collectively.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='notes'
    title='Obsidian'
    href='https://obsidian.md'
    desc='Love the local-first approach, the wide variety of extensions available, and how you can structure your notes the way you want to (this came in very clutch during my uni years).'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='misc'
    title='Swish'
    href='https://highlyopinionated.co/swish'
    desc='A neat window-manager app that leverages trackpad gestures (after this, wanting to own a wireless mouse becomes very undesirable).'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='misc'
    title='BatFi'
    href='https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi'
    desc='A battery management app that allows me to set an indefinite charging limit on my Mac, without having to worry about Appleâ€™s built-in battery optimisations messing things up.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='misc'
    title='BetterDisplay'
    href='https://betterdisplay.pro'
    desc='A display management utility that allows you to convert external displays to use Appleâ€™s HiDPI, which gives you significantly sharper text. Hook this up nicely with a resolution that gives you enough screen estate (while still being crisp), and youâ€™ve got a winner.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='misc'
    title='Clop'
    href='https://lowtechguys.com/clop'
    desc='An image, video, pdf and clipboard optimiser, which Iâ€™ve set up to run upon a file being copied/downloaded.'
  />
  <SectionListItem
    badge='misc'
    title='Alcove'
    href='https://tryalcove.com'

    href='https://dropoverapp.com'
    desc='An app that makes drag and drop very easy, with you being able to group items into stashes.'
