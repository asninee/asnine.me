This site was created to have my own, tiny little bubble on the internet, being able to express myself about any topics of interest. It's an interesting mix of my personal profile and blog, all-in-one, but a better classification would be a [digital garden](https://lowercasedc.wordpress.com/2023/02/01/what-the-heck-is-a-digital-garden).

It acts as the perfect excuse to test out new and exciting technologies, allowing me to learn new things and improve my skills. Of course with this, there's a constant stream of tweaks/updates being brought forward to improve the experience for you, the end-user. After all, the idea of a finished product is a [myth](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/the-myth-of-the-finished-product).

## Philosophy

Above all else, I want this site to be kind to both the planet, and the reader. In practice, this means:

- Minimising the site's network payload as much as possible (`40kb` bundle size, [99% cleaner](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/asnine-me) than all web pages globally).
- Using little to no JS, and prioritising HTML and CSS.
- No analytics/tracking [whatsoever](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=asnine.me&location=us&device=mobile&force=false).
- Delivering content using the most optimised formats available (`.woff2` for fonts, `.webp` for imgs).

Additional focuses include:

- Performance: the above measures should help to guarantee quick site loading times, but there should be a habit of continally pursuing optimisations and applying them ([`100/100`](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-asnine-me/j2ofvdcfno?formfactor=mobile) on Google's PageSpeed Insights).
- Simplicity: this should be applied in as many aspects as possible e.g. aesthetic, file structure, used technologies to name a few. Everything should have it's own specific purpose, with any unnecessary bloat being removed.
- Scalability: upon having a simplistic and solid base, refactoring the application logic to guarantee that the site is able to scale up with the changes of tomorrow is a must, where employing external integrations and libraries can help towards this.

## Typography

This site heavily features the [BDO Grotesk](https://lokalcontainer.com/BDO-Grotesk) typeface, where it satiated my hunt for a [Helvetica Neue](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/neue-helvetica-font-linotype) alternative. For code blocks and snippets, [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka) is used, where it's my go-to monospace font at this point.

## Inspiration

This site wouldn't be what it is without the exceptional work of individuals such as [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me) and [Rauno Freiberg](https://raunofreiberg.com), where I was gobsmacked by the simplistic beauty of their sites, causing me to re-think how I wanted to approach the task of nailing down the design of the site. It was their work that led me to the path of wanting to chase simplicity at all costs, where I've had a great amount of fun realising the renewed vision sparked by these individuals.

I'd like to especially thank [hasparus](https://github.com/hasparus) with his work on [zaduma](https://zaduma.vercel.app), and [nexxeln](https://github.com/nexxeln) with his work on [nexxel.dev](https://www.nexxel.dev), where the initial concepts of the site was very much inspired by both of these sites.
