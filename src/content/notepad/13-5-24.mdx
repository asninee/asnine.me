Deciding on a sans-serif font is proving to be a **_very_** arduous task. In an ideal world, I'd love to use Helvetica Neue, but the fact that it is only available on Apple devices means that other users would miss out on seeing the site as I envisaged (_I know, I'm picky like that_).

While I'm at it, I'll attach a few great font sites that I've run into:

- [Uncut](https://uncut.wtf)
- [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com)
