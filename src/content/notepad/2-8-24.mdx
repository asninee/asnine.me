To the super attentive out there: you've probably noticed that this site has undergone a lot of changes (stylistically speaking) to put it lightly.

I'll update the colophon in the not-too-distant future, but it essentially comes down to just continually immersing myself towards ensuring that this site comes across in a manner that I consider perfect.

Reaching perfection is a subjective thing, which of course will change as we experience new things. This in-turn leads to the cycle of change kickstarting once again, as we attempt to chase this new "perfect" in front of us. But change isn't a bad thing at all. It's that feedback loop that we incite from simply experiencing/applying new things that allows us to elevate our crafts, and crawl closer to mastery.

After all, we are all unpolished gems, continually refining ourselves as we go along.
