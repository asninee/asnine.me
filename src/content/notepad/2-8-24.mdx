To the super attentive out there: you've probably noticed that this site has undergone a **lot** of changes (stylistically speaking) to put it lightly.

I'll update the colophon in the not-too-distant future, but it essentially comes down to just continually immersing myself towards ensuring that this site (the living proof of myself as an individual) comes across in a manner that I consider **perfect**.

My interpretation of perfect will of course change as I expose myself to more things as a whole, which will inevitably kickstart the process of change over and over again. But change isn't a bad thing at all. It's that feedback loop that we incite from simply experiencing/applying new things that allows us to elevate our crafts.

After all, we are all unpolished gems, continually refining ourselves as we go along.
