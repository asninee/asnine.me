tldr: the new [Pixel](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/) line of phones has made me clueless about Google's smartphone strategy.

The "AI phone" marketing shtick falls flat when you consider that the Tensor G4 chip is generations behind it's competition in terms of **both** performance and efficiency. Now, let's assume that they've added booster rockets onto the NPU; the poor thermal efficiency caused by the use of Samsung's process nodes will still come to haunt them, and (most likely) turn the phone into a space heater when running AI functions (prior models **already** had [overheating](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/search/?q=overheating&type=link&cId=f359646c-0936-4b02-b2a1-63a0a6e8c375&iId=1482c876-2bcc-4364-a9de-a31233fe7e5f) issues when running less intensive tasks).

The fact that Google is now placing the new Pixels in **price-parity** with Apple's offerings is just egregious when your product is known not to have the bullet-proof reliability of Apple products, which ironically is (pretty much) rooted from the poor SoC. Why would I, as a consumer, buy a Pixel in good faith when I can get a **much** more [performant](https://wccftech.com/google-tensor-g3-slower-than-three-year-old-apple-a14-bionic/), [efficient](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_8_pro_vs_apple_iphone_15_pro_max_review_battery_camera_price_compared-news-60413.php#battery) and reliable product in the iPhone for the **same price**? No matter what camera magic Google may be doing, the **fundamentals** are there to be met.

It's basically a **no-contest** (in my eyes), which is a serious shame as a Pixel user myself; looks like it may be time to switch sides soon.
