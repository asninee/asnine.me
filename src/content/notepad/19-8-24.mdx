tldr: the new [Pixel](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/) line of phones has made me clueless about Google's smartphone strategy.

The "AI phone" marketing shtick falls flat when you consider that the Tensor G4 chip is generations behind it's competition in terms of both performance and efficiency. They're also using the same NPU as last year, which means all the new capabilities is just "software magic", which all recent Android devices can tap into with an Android update.

The fact that Google is now placing the new Pixels in price-parity with Apple's offerings is just egregious when they are lagging behind in [ultimate performance](https://wccftech.com/google-tensor-g3-slower-than-three-year-old-apple-a14-bionic/), [efficiency](https://arc.net/l/quote/goyayumf) and reliability. No matter what camera magic Google may be doing, the fundamentals are there to be met.

It's basically a no-contest (in my eyes), which is a serious shame as a Pixel user myself; looks like it may be time to switch sides soon.
