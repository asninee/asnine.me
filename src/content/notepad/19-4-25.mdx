I've done a pretty great job with letting things run stale here, huh? ðŸ˜…

On a serious note though, I've just been in a more introspective mood lately (I still am), where it's good to be in touch with your deeper thoughts and feelings (I'll probably touch base on this in a future post). When we're so deeply enthralled in the "now", we often forget to reflect on what "was", and the "wants" of the future.

A good friend of mine put it best:

> "the path to everything starts with self love, to be able to give weight and power to your own idea and self, to be able to value yourself even when stripped from everything else".
