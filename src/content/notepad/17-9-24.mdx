Remember the [curated lists](https://deadsimplesites.com/) that I'd look up to for inspo? (I brought up in my [first blog post](https://asnine.me/blog/a-new-start)). I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I made the cut! ðŸ¥¹

I'd like to give the biggest of thanks to [Arcade Labs](https://arcade.la/) for admitting my site in, where I can hopefully serve to inspire others to create simple, but elegant sites.
