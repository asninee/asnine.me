So, I went ahead and got myself the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I'm forever thankful to my trusty Pixel 4a, but I couldn't carry on due to how bad the battery life had gotten (1.5 hrs SOT). As a long-time small phone person, this was a big departure in many ways, but the supreme [battery life](https://arc.net/l/quote/cgtrniku) (2 days of SOT for me), quality app optimisation (courtesy of iOS), and rock-solid longevity associated with iPhones essentially won me over.

I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't miss the simple one-handed operation of a smaller phone, but having a smaller phone results in less battery life now, and worse degradation later on. Despite having small-ish hands, I'm surprised at how much I've been able to adapt to the screen size, still doesn't help that this thing is basically a brick in my pocket.

While I'd normally recommend upgrading every 4-5 years, I don't see myself upgrading for the next 7 years at a minimum. This phone is very overkill for my needs, where I only make use of a small selection of essential apps, so there should be no excuses (I probably could have gotten away with buying a 16, but that [Natural Titanium](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/650c33b45988dea5316c9012/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2826,1933,x0,y180,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds) ðŸ˜‹).
