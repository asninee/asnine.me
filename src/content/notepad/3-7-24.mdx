**Life update:** I started (two days ago) at [Evelyn Partners](https://www.evelyn.com)!

It was amazing to meet some of the team today, with there being a very pronounced soothing sorta feeling. Everyone just focuses on crushing what's in front of them; and that's how it should be, but with the additional _sprinkle_ of supportiveness that helps to alleviate that first-day imposter syndrome feeling.

Now, you've probably had a look at the job title, and I can guess that you're still pondering as to what it actually means (_I did too for a while_). To succinctly put it, it can be thought of as a full-stack role with a front-end focus.

I'm very much looking forward to creating plenty of memorable moments with the rest of the development team.
